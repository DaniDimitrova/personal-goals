Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? [Una Kravets](https://una.im/personal-goals-guide/) and [Sofiya Semenova](https://sofiya.io/notblog/personal) inspired me. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Be organized, focused, and productive at work
2. Devote time to side projects
3. Contribute to open source
4. Stay healthy and fit
6. Be kind
